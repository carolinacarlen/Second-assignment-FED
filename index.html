            <p> So I decided to try out the camping life, and I headed to Ibiza in the not so popular month of november.
                I found a camper with an ok price on airbnb and I decided to rent it for three weeks. 
                This was going to be a trip for a meditative retreat where I would only eat raw food 
                and meditate on my bodily sensations and tensions. To gain a sense of more freedom in other words.</p>
             <p>Ibiza was pretty empty with people, and during my first nights the rain was pouring down and there was a 
                massive storm! To get some more heat in my litte home, I put on the heating from turning on the cars elecetricity
                and yes, the next day the car wouldn't start - the batteri was out. And of course, my reception on my phone was gone. 
                My warmest clothes were wet so I had to go in the cold weather to the nearest point where I could get som reception 
                and call for help. </p>   
            <p> It was a challenging time on Ibiza which shortened from 3 weeks to 5 days... but I got some real nice organic fruits,
                some exciting nights in a van in a stormy weather and beautiful scenery! 
                I will come back for you Ibiza. In a different setting.  
            </p>
